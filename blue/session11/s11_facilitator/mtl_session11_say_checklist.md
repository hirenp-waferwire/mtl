# Today we're modeling to learn how to make _future_ team decisions

Hello! I'm \________________ (facilitator's name) and I'm \_______________ (co-facilitator's name). Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.

## Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done and Do

- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Done** We thought about possible decisions or changes the team could make in clinical care based on our comparison of the bc, exp 1, exp 2 and exp 3 in mtl.how/sim.

- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Do** We will discuss the team's learning using C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills and prioritize ways to implement new practice decisions in our clinical care.|

## Emphasize team priority with the learning objectives on the screen

**Learning Objectives for Session 11**

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic.
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking.

## Facilitator prepare team-tailored C.F.B.T. rationale for the session 11 discussion: We've been _Modeling to Learn_ how to use systems thinking when making care decisions in our team.

_Prepare your script to model and reflect team decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking_

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | --
**Complex** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Forest   not trees.**    Relationships among two or more **units** (patients, weeks), **variables** (_stocks_: patients waiting to start, _flows_: improvement rate), or two or more **settings** (primary care, general mental health).
**Feedback** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Loop not line.**    Not simple cause and effect. The end of   the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (**reinforcing**)   or reduced (**balancing**) around the loop.
**System Behavior** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Movie   not snapshot.**    Trends over time.    Systems _cause_ their own behavior through feedback.
**Time** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Short   and   long term.**      Better understanding of change over time   (e.g., worse before better, better before worse, better before a lot better, worse before a lot worse).

 <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:10-00:20**

- [ ] 1. We've made lots of **team decisions,** including selecting ______________ as team lead.  

- [ ] 2. **Shared vision** for *Modeling to Learn* _______________  

- [ ] 3. In sessions 2 and 3 we found key **team trends** _______________  

- [ ] 4. In session 4 we used the *MTL* Menu and identified our **highest priority team need** now __________________  

- [ ] 5. In sessions 5 through 10 we learned to tell a **causal system story** of our team's need using the __________________ **causal feedback.**  

- [ ] **New individual and team practice decisions** that apply C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills:  

  - ___________________ [exp 1]  

  - ___________________ [exp 2]  

  - ___________________ [exp 3]  

## Discuss **new individual and team practice decisions** using **C.F.B.T. systems thinking** rationale for **why** a practice decision would lead to desired outcomes over time

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:20-00:50**

- What insights we will keep in mind as we make future team decisions?
- What new decisions, approaches, or targets do we want to adopt in our team?  
- Let's think about the key insights we've gotten about decisions that are within our control.
- What concrete actions will we take?
- How do those decisions align with our team's vision and needs?  
- What data will we watch to see how we're doing?  

## Have Team Lead pull up the session 09 SEE guide Done/Do review

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:50-00:55**

- [ ] Done: We discussed the team's learning and new individual and team practice decisions that apply **C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills** in prioritized ways to implement it in our clinical care.
- [ ] Reflect on our team's vision for MTL and our **MTL participatory learning experience** to prepare next steps and wrap-up MTL.
