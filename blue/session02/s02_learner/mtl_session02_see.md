# MTL Live Session 02

## Today we're modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.

2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.

3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## *MTL* on BISL

### 1. Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data. First select your VISN and then select your facility. [NEED TO UPDATE FOR PBI]

**_MTL_ 2.5.

**For _MTL_ 2.0, click [here] (insert link of 2.0 release archive)

### Your Team Data 

### 2. Go to the ClinicSelection tab in Power BI. Use the columns to select the clinics that make up your team.

- You can sort and filter by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Provider.
- Note: Leaving the "Is Inactive" column blank will pull all clinics used in the last two years, including de-activated clinics (denoted by a "ZZ" prefix). If you do not wish for inactive clinics to be pulled, under the "Is Inactive?" column, check "No" and click "Apply."
- After making all your selections, click the "Apply" button.

[INSERT GIF OF CLINIC SELECTIONS]

**Note: Unselecting**
- To unselect an individual Division, Physical Location, etc, double click the selected box.
- To clear all selected choices, hover in the upper right hand corner of the column and click on the 'Eraser' icon, shown highlighted below.

**For _MTL_ 2.0, click [here] (insert link of 2.0 release archive)

### 3. Viewing your Team Data. 
- Clicking "Apply" pulls your Patient Level Data. 
- (We will not do this in-session today. - CLARIFY)
- Navigate to the "Data" tabs (shown below) to view this data. We will work more with this data in Session 3. 
CLARIFY THIS IS STILL CORRECT:
- **To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions.** To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click [here](https://spsites.cdw.va.gov/sites/PBM_AD/_layouts/15/ReportServer/RSViewerPage.aspx?rv%3aRelativeReportUrl=/sites/PBM_AD/AnalyticsReports/LSVAccessVerification.rdl) (VA intranet link to access verification).
- **If you don't have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify:**
   1. CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS).
   2. Your network username recorded in VistA.
   To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined [here](https://vaww.dev.fre.cdw.va.gov/sites/D05_VISN21/DashboardDevelopment/Updating%20Network%20UserName%20in%20VistA.aspx) (VA intranet link to Vista).

**Note for _MTL_ 2.5** The **Filter** Feature  
- In order to find filters: Navigate to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
- In order to use the filters: Click on the column which needs to be filtered, and the appropriate filters will appear i
- **Important** There is no visual indication when filters are turned on - You **must** unhide the filter panel in order to see which filters are active. This is different in MTL 2.5 from the previous version in MTL 2.0. 
- If you ever can't find something you expect, click on the funnel
- "Filters and slicers affecting this visual" means filters are active.

### 5. Click to view the "viz" tab, which show team trends.

- There are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- What stands out to you?
- What is most important to you to check out first?
- What is most surprising?

**Note for _MTL_ 2.5** The "Quick Explore" feature is no longer available. (But tables are still available)

REPLACE WITH CURRENT 2.5 INFORMATION:

**_MTL_ 2.0. 
For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md)**

### 6. Click to view the "data" tab, which show your team's individual patient information.

- Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in the "Patient Name" column. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from the "Patient SSN" Column, or "Patient Name" Column. 
- Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.

** _MTL_ 2.0**
- dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses", specifying which diagnosis is primary.

[![primary diagnosis example graphic](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/primary_diagnoses.png)](#DontLink)

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md).

- What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?
- What **viz** option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
- Are there services that have been increasing over time? Are there services that have been decreasing over time?

**With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.**
