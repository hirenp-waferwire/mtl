# MTL Live Session 02 Facilitator Checklist

- [ ]  Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________. Today we're modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends.

- [ ] Navigate to the Learner See Guide for Session 2 to show Done and Do

## Learning Objectives for Session 2
1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data.
2. Test out whether your expectations about team historical trends are displayed in the "viz" tabs.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

## Start in-session exercise. Note the goal is to become familiar with *MTL* data user interface (data UI) that looks back over 2 years of team data.

## Participatory Learning from Simulation
- [ ] Graphic: how *MTL* can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.
- [ ] We use the data user interface (UI) to:
	- look back at team trends over the past two years.
	- review the last two years of data to see *what is* in our team now.
		* Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.
* Reviewing trends: may like or not like the trends; may not know what is causing those trends; may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it. 
- [ ] Review use of sim UI – to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make.

- [ ] Confirm who will "drive" today [Recommend the Team Lead]

### 1. On any browser, navigate to mtl.how/data.
- [ ] Explain the Business Intelligence Service Line (or BISL) -- VA’s corporate data warehouse site.
	- You must have your PIV engaged to access the site.
- *Reminder:* BISL site contains Protected Health Information (PHI) - access is according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.  
- We'll show you how files you pull from here will be saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work.
- [ ] Select your VISN **______________**. 
- [ ] On the next page, select your team's facility **______________**.  
    
## To create a fresh data UI file, go through Steps #2-4. We will show you the steps but you already have a fresh data UI file.

### 2. Your Team Data Folder - Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel.
 
   
### 3. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. 
   [ ] Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team. 
   [ ] Follow the instructions in **Box A2.**  
   [ ] Double-click on clinics to add them to column A, or you can highlight the clinics and click the gray "add all" button (Box B6) to add them to column A.  
 
### 4. To view your team patient data and your team trends click on "Get-Patient-level Data." 

## You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your data_ui folder. With your team lead (________), we selected the following clinics to represent your team.   
-	It takes some time to stitch together a "hyper-local" query tailored to your team from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse,  may be up to 15 minutes.
-	**Prior to today's session, __________________ [Team Lead's name] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.
-	**Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?

### 5. Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.  

    [ ] Let's go to the **[__ ]** viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.  
    [ ] **"Quick Explore**" (look for the magnifying glass). In the **"Explore"** box, pick the item you want to explore and click on **"Drill To**". Keep using Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. You can always click on the gray **"Reset Pivot Chart"** button to return to the original settings.

    [ ] **What stands out to you about ________________________________**[fill-in team vision]**?  
  
    [ ] **What is most important to you to check out first related to  ________________________________**[fill-in team vision]?
    [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended quesiton]?  
      [ ] **What is most surprising?**  
    [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended quesiton]?

### 6. Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.  

    [ ]  Patients with restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Column F & G.  
    [ ] Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.  
    [ ] Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.

Time Stamp | Team Learning Priorities | Script

**[Prioritize which questions you will use given this team's guiding vision.** |  |  |

Keep an eye on time |  |  |   

    [ ] What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on.  
    [ ] What **viz** tab would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?  
    [ ] Are there services that have been **increasing over time?** 
    [ ] Are there services that have been **decreasing over time?**  

### That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review.
