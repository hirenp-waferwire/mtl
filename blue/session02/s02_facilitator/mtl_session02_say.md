# MTL Live Session 02

Hello! I'm \________________ (facilitator's name) and I'm \_______________ (co-facilitator's name). Navigating to the Learner See Guide for Session 2 at mtl.how, we see that today we're modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.
2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

### Participatory Learning from Simulation

This graphic illustrates how **_Modeling to Learn_** can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.

- We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years.
- We review the last two years of data to see *what is* in our team now.
- Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.
- Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it.
- It is also really demotivating to see trends we don't like, and not know what is causing the problem.
- We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make. What we're doing today is that *looking back* using the data UI.
[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">](#DontLink)
- Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.

## In-Session Exercise

## Let's get started!

**Who would like to "drive" today?** \(Recommend the Team Lead\)

### 1. **Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data..**

- This will take you to the Power BI site, ensure you have your PIV card to access the intranet site. This site contains Protected Health Information (PHI), so as a provider you will be granted access according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.
- We'll be opening the _Modeling to Learn_ data user interface (UI) in Power BI here today.
- We'll show you how data you pull from here will be saved back to this secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work. 
- On the landing page, you will select your clinics using the columns present.
- You can search and filter for Clinics by Provider after making selections in Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and/or Is Inactive columns.
-  **With your team lead (________), we selected the following clinics to represent your team.**
-  After making all your selections in a column, click the yellow "Apply" button.

- *Note: Leaving the "Is Inactive" column blank will pull all de-activated clinics used in the last two years (denoted by a "ZZ" prefix). If you do not wish for inactive clinics to be pulled, under the "Is Inactive" column, check "No" and click the yellow "Apply" button.*

- To unselect an individual Division, Physical Location, etc, uncheck the selected box.
- To clear selected choices in a **column**, hover in the upper right hand corner of the column and click on the 'Eraser' icon. 
- To reset ALL choices in the interface across ALL tabs, click the "Reset" button in the upper bar. Note - the "reset" button will clear ALL choices across ALL Clinic Selection, Data, & Viz tabs, not just the given tab you are viewing.

## To view your team data, go through Step #2. We will show you the steps, but you already have access to your data report.
(*WILL THEY BE DOING STEP 2?** - Need to clarify w/Jeff on 11/29 8am WG Leads to see if we can share clinic selection w/ team members or if they all have to go thru this step)

### 2. Viewing your Team Data. 
- Clicking "Apply" after making choices in the "Clinic Selection" Tab pulled your Patient Level Data.
- This will pull all clinics used in the last two years.
- To zoom in on the data and view it clearly, hover in the upper right hand corner of the screen until a set of icons appear. Click on the square "Focus Mode" icon. Hit "Back to Report" to return to the previous view. 

- **Prior to today's session, __________________ \[Team Lead's name\] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.  
- **__________________ [Team Lead's name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team's dataset?**  
- **Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?** 

- **To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions.** To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the [link](https://spsites.cdw.va.gov/sites/PBM_AD/_layouts/15/ReportServer/RSViewerPage.aspx?rv%3aRelativeReportUrl=/sites/PBM_AD/AnalyticsReports/LSVAccessVerification.rdl) to access the document through VA intranet.
- **If you don't have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify:**
   1. CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS).
   2. Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the [linked document](https://vaww.dev.fre.cdw.va.gov/sites/D05_VISN21/DashboardDevelopment/Updating%20Network%20UserName%20in%20VistA.aspx) through VA intranet.

**New in _MTL_ 2.5** 
- Suicide and Behavior Risk Flags now has its own tab!
   - We know staff pay close attention behavioral and suicide risk and have now pulled those data and visualizations into their own separate tabs.
- _MTL_ 2.5 now has 5 Data Tabs and 5 Viz Tabs. 
    
### 3. **Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.**
- Just like the facility data, there are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.  Your team's vision was about \_______________.  Let's go to the \_________________ viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.
- You can explore further in the "viz" tabs by right clicking on any trend line and "Show As Table." (The "Quick Explore" feature is no longer available.)

- *Note on Drill Up View: The "Drill Up" View shows a zoomed-out view of the data. However, please note that the shoulders in monthly and yearly views are not meaningful since we do not have all days of observation in a month, or 12 months of observation in each year, respectively for all of the months and years.*

- Hover in the right hand corner and click on the "Focus Mode" icon to zoom in on the visualization.
- Unhide the Filter panel in the right hand side of the screen to use filters and view specific variables. 

- vizDiag in the data UI shows a trendlines by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the "PTSD" line is for patients with only PTSD. The "PTSD & AUD" line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses.

   - **What stands out to you about \________________________________**\(fill-in team vision\)?
   - **What is most important to you to check out first related to \________________________________**\(fill-in team vision\)?
    \(Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question\)?  
   - **What is most surprising?** \(Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question\)?

### 6. **Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.**
   - Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (******) in the "Patient Name" column. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from the "Patient SSN" Column, or "Patient Name" Column.
   - Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
   - Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.
   - dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses". "Diagnoses of Interest" retains all the current unordered diagnoses combinations, while "Primary Diagnoses" indicates what is the primary diagnosis. This means that if there is only one diagnosis in the "Diagnoses of Interest" column, it will still repeat what that diagnosis is in the "Primary Diagnoses" column.

   \(During intersession prep facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.\)

   **Prioritize which questions you will use given this team's guiding vision.** |  |  |
   [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontLink) Keep an eye on    time | **Themes from the team vision to be highlighted.** | **Team Data related questions to Prioritize with the Team.**
   |  |  |

   - What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number \(EBP template\) that the patient is on.
   - What **viz** tab would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
   - Are there services that have been **increasing over time?**
   - Are there services that have been **decreasing over time?**
   - With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.

**Filtering the "data" tabs:**

- In order to find filters, navigate to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
- In order to apply filters, click on the column which needs to be filtered, and the appropriate filters will appear. 
- **Note:** If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied.
   - Click on the **funnel icon** in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual".
   - You must **unhide the right-hand filter panel** in order to see which specific filters are active. 

**That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review.**
