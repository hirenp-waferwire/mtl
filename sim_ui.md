## Background
The *Modeling to Learn* simulation user-interface is used in *Modeling to Learn Blue* Sessions 5-10 to run simulation experiments of the frontline team's operations and coordination. The co-facilitators helps each team decide on a module during Session 4 using the *Modeling to Learn* Menu based on the team's needs and highest priorities. 

The team can choose from 5 modules: Care Coordination, Medication Management, Psychotherapy, Aggregate Mix of Services, and Measurement Based Care and Suicide Prevention. Over the course of *MTL*, the team runs 4 scenarios relevant to their care team's operations - basecase of no new decisions, experiment 1, experiment 2, and experiment 3.

## [Simulation User-Interface (mtl.how/sim)](https://mtl.how/sim)
Using their VA email, clinicians can login to two types of environments on the simulation user-interface, or sim UI: team world and individual world. There is one team world per team which includes all members of the care team as well as the co-facilitators for making team decisions to run experiments together. There is one individual world per team member for running extra experiments on their own.

The sim UI also includes the following navigation icons & features:
- Team: Click on this to chat with your team or co-facilitator live during the session
- More Info: Click on this to read more info about the different modules and functions of the simulation user-interface
- News: Click on this to quickly read the current news flashes on Community of Practice discussion items. This icon includes a red notification button alerting you to the number of unread messages, similar to the notification system on your phone!
- Report Bug: Click on this to report any issues, including the option to include screenshots. No PII/PHI please!
- Tutor: Click on this icon for an "over the shoulder" walk through of the different icons, headers, and functions across the simulation user-interface with navigation buttons. These pop-ups also include links to the TMS video and relevant session guide further detailing the section.
- Community: Click on this floating button to contribute ideas, like something, or ask a question on the online Community of Practice. You can also further search the Community of Practice for previously answered questions or to get involved in any discussions. No PII/PHI here please!
- Quick Tips: Anytime you're waiting for a new screen to load, a quick tip and related icon will pop-up to remind you of different functions.
