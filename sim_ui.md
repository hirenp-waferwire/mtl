## Background
The *Modeling to Learn* simulation user-interface is used in *Modeling to Learn Blue* Sessions 5-10 to run simulation experiments of the frontline team's operations and coordination. The co-facilitators helps each team decide on a module during Session 4 using the *Modeling to Learn* Menu based on the team's needs and highest priorities. 

The team can choose from 5 modules: Care Coordination, Medication Management, Psychotherapy, Aggregate Mix of Services, and Measurement Based Care and Suicide Prevention. Over the course of *MTL*, the team runs 4 scenarios relevant to their care team's operations - basecase of no new decisions, experiment 1, experiment 2, and experiment 3.

## Simulation User-Interface
Using their VA email, clinicians can login to two types of environments on the simulation user-interface, or sim UI: team world and individual world. There is one team world per team which includes all members of the care team as well as the co-facilitators for making team decisions to run experiments together. There is one individual world per team member for running extra experiments on their own.

The sim UI also includes the following navigation icons:
- Chat
- More Info
- News
- Report Bug
- Tutor 
- Community


Click on the "Team" icon to chat with your team or facilitator.

Click on the "More Info" icon for more info on the sim UI.

Click on the "News" icon for news flashes on discussion items. Your input on discussion items in the Community of Practice is appreciated. A red pop-up with a number will appear next to this icon (similar to how text messages work on your phone) to alert you to the number of un-read news flashes. Once you read the news flashes, the red pop-up will disappear, but you can always click on "News" to review the current new flashes.
