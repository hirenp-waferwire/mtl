## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe the criteria determined to build your team in the *MTL* Data User Interface.

2.	Test your expectations about team historical trends against actual results in the "data", "viz" and "count" tabs.

3.	Apply your clinical expertise to translate learnings from the *MTL* Data UI into team decisions.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## *MTL* on BISL

### 1. Open Internet Explorer. Go to mtl.how/data. First select your VISN and then select your facility.
+ For best results, please use Internet Explorer or Edge. SharePoint is a Microsoft platform and works best with Microsoft web browsers.

### 2. Explore the information available in the BISL SharePoint splash page.
[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/data_ui_splashpage.gif)](#DontLink)

- Click on the View dropdown in the top right corner. What View options are there and what do they mean? Hints:
  - Count: Aggregate Data for Viz trends
  - Data: Sortable report of data
  - Diag: Diagnostic data 
  - Enc: Encounter types of visits
  - HF: Health Factors data related to visits
  - Meas: Measures or flag names
  - Viz: Visualization of trends  
  

- vizDiag shows unique visits by primary diagnosis on the visit of PTSD, Dep, OUD, or AUD. 

- What filtering options are available? 
  - Filter to your clinic or division using the grey buttons to see trends for the last two years.
  
## Your Team Data Folder

### 3. Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel.

- Click on the data_ui file. This will show a preview in your Explorer or Edge browser window.

- Click on "Edit Workbook" dropdown at the top and then, "Edit in Excel."

### 4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team.
- You can sort and filter by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Provider.
- Note: This will pull all clinics used in the last two years (including de-activated clinics: denoted by "ZZ"). For de-activated clinics, you can find the date of de-activation in column I.
- Follow the instructions in **Box A2.** 
- After filtering, click the "Add All" arrow in column B (Cell B6). Fine-tune your selections by double-clicking on the clinic name in column A (to remove) or column C (to add).
- In the future, if you want to quickly get the same list of clinics again, you can select the grey "Get previous clinic list from last click of Get Patient-level Data" arrow in Column B (Cell B3).

### 5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click "Get Patient-level Data." We will not do this in-session today.
- **You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your team data_ui folder.** 
- We will learn about the "Create Team Data Table" button in our next team meeting.


### NOTE: It takes some time to run a query from your team data UI to the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. 
- On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data, and Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data.

### 6. Click to view the "viz" tab, which show team trends.
- There are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
  - What stands out to you?
  - What is most important to you to check out first?
  - What is most surprising?

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/session2_data_ui_4_viz_diag.gif)](#DontLink)

- Click on any trend line and then "Quick Explore" (look for the magnifying glass). In the "Explore" box, pick the item you want to explore and click "Drill To." Keep using the Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. 
  -To return to the original settings, click on the gray "Reset Pivot Chart."
  - The viz tabs will also return to default selections, when you click "Get Patient-level Data" for new data pulls.

- Right click on a trend line and filter to hide a selected item or only keep the selected item.

- vizDiag in the data UI shows a drill down by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses.

### 7. Click to view the "data" tab, which show your team's individual patient information.
- Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Columns F & G. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from Column H.
- Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports. 
- dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses", specifying which diagnosis is primary.

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/primary_diagnoses.png)](#DontLink)

- What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?
- What **viz** option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
- Are there services that have been increasing over time? Are there services that have been decreasing over time?

## With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.
