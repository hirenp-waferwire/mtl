2. Go to the desired file location and click on the file.
3. Click "Open" to upload the file.  

**Please Note.**

- The upload routine must update multiple GitHub repositories and Epicenter, which may take a few minutes. If the file does not appear, try clicking the "Refresh" button.
- **Do not attempt to upload Team Data file directly to Epicenter,** since the GitHub repository will overwrite the files on the next update and they will not work when you try to access them from the Sim UI.
