Co-facilitators help each team select one of 5 simulation modules during Sessions 1-4 based on the team’s vision, needs and priorities. The 5 modules are Care Coordination, Medication Management, Psychotherapy, Aggregate Mix of Services, and Measurement Based Care and Suicide Prevention. Each team runs 4 simulation experiments in their selected module: their basecase of no new decisions; experiment 1 testing the team’s first hypothesis for addressing their priority need; experiment 2 testing their second hypothesis; and experiment 3, combining multiple new decisions the team could implement. 2.1.2 Simulation User-Interface (mtl.how/sim) Using their VA email, clinicians can login to one of two types of environments, or “worlds”, in the sim UI: the Team world or the Individual world. The team world allows access to all team members so they can combine their thinking and run experiments together. The individual world is a unique environment where each team member can run experiments on their own and explore beyond the collective work of the team. Co-facilitators can “map” themselves to team and individual worlds in various ways for different purposes, as described further under Forio Epicenter backend management. The sim UI includes the following navigation icons &amp; features: Icons Team: Click on this to chat with your team or co-facilitator live during the session More Info: Click on this to read more info about the different modules and functions of the simulation user-interface News: Click on this to quickly read the current news flashes on Community of Practice discussion items. This icon includes a red notification button alerting you to the number of unread messages, similar to the notification system on your phone! Report Bug: Click on this to report any issues, including the option to include screenshots. No PII/PHI please! Tutor: Click on this icon for an “over the shoulder” walk through of the different icons, headers, and functions across the simulation user-interface with navigation buttons. These pop-ups also include links to the TMS video and relevant session guide further detailing the section. Community: Click on this floating button to contribute ideas, like something, or ask a question on the online Community of Practice. You can also further search the Community of Practice for previously answered questions or to get involved in any discussions. No PII/PHI here please! Features Quick Tips: Anytime you’re waiting for a new screen to load, a quick tip and related icon will pop-up to remind you of different functions. Alerts: If we need to alert users of any urgent or sensitive news, a pop-up will flash once logged in with details. 2.1.3 Forio Epicenter Admin (mtl.how/facilitate) All co-facilitators and HQ support team members will create an Epicenter login and be added to the TeamPSD project on Epicenter. From here, co-facilitators will be able to see and have access to the Development (Dev), Test, and Production (Prod) environments of all TeamPSD tools hosted on Epicenter (mtl.how/sim, mtl.how/team, and mtl.how/demo). This platform also gives access to the underlying model files that run the simulation user-interface. However, these are not to be changed or accessed by anyone, except the model workgroup. Dev – This instance is for the exclusive use of the Development Team (A.K.A. “DEV”). Dev develops each sprint in this instance until they are satisfied it is ready for user testing. When iterations are completed, the sprint is promoted to PROD. Test – This instance is for the Workgroup Leads and others to conduct user testing of the current sprint. When the testing and resulting development iterations are completed, the sprint is promoted to PROD. Prod – This is the Production instance that is available for the Modeling to Learn learners to use. (include explanation of dev, test, prod) - The underlying model files responsible for running the simulation user-interface Through the Epicenter backend platform, users can: Manage team data files Manage permissions and add new end users Add new learners and facilitators Manage, create, and troubleshoot team groups, worlds, and roles By changing roles to a facilitator instead of a learner, users can also access the Facilitator Dashboard which includes: Dashboards: Click here to see a quick overview on progress of each experiment for the team, team roster, and statistics on each team experiment (i.e. time taken, attendance, etc.) Community (THIS SAYS PLDR CAN WE CHANGE): Click here to see which users have contributed to the Community of Practice as well as the corresponding issue number for GitHub. Users can also manage text for the Community button, News, and Alerts. Chat: Click here to chat back with the team during a live session More Info: Click here to add or edit text displayed in the More Info section of the sim UI. Tutor: Click here to add or edit text &amp; links displayed in the Tutor pop-ups. Tips: Click here to add or edit text &amp; icons displayed in the Quick Tips pop-ups. 2.1.4 Maps Run a new experiment Add your avatar Upload a fresh team data file Manage previously run experiments Create and manage groups and worlds Suppress a world Change roles a learner to a facilitator Edit “More Info” content Edit “Quick Tips” content View team progress using the facilitator dashboard Add a new end user 2.1.5 Cheatsheets Simulation user-interface or sim UI cheatsheet 2.1.6 Checklists Pre-session review checklist 2.2 BISL SharePoint and Data UI 2.2.1 Relevant Shortlinks mtl.how/data 2.2.2 Background The Modeling to Learn BISL SharePoint and data user-interface (data UI) are used in Modeling to Learn Red Part 1 &amp; 2 and Modeling to Learn Blue Session 2 &amp; 3 to view hyper-local data and teams trends. The BISL SharePoint includes PHI/PII 2.2.3 BISL SharePoint Using the permissions on their PIV, clincians can access the VA’s corporate data warehouse (CDW) site, the Business Intelligence Service Line (BISL). Clinicians can drill down to their local data by selecting their VISN &amp; then facility on the landing page. Each facility’s landing page includes: - facility_data.xlsb - Master_DataUI folder including - master data_UI file pre-selected for the respective facility/station - mtl.how/data cheatsheet - sta6a station lookup file for the respective facility/station - team folders 2.2.4 Facility Data Using the filtering options within the facility data Excel spreadsheet, clinicians can filter down to their local clinic or division to see trends for the last two years. The facility data includes the following view options and data sets: Views - Count (in Viz tabs): Aggregate Data for Viz trends - Data: Sortable report of data - Viz: Visualization of trends Displays - Diag: Diagnostic data - Enc: Encounter types of visits - HF: Health Factors data related to visits - Meas: Measures or flag names 2.2.5 Data User-Interface Using the permissions on their PIV, clincians can query two types of data using the data user-interface (data UI) found in the Master_DataUI folder: Patient-level Data Shows team trends over the past 2 years. Each team can sort and filter by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Providert to produce a “hyper-local” query tailored to their team. Once the query is done, you can: View the “viz” tab to show team trends. View the “data” tab, to show the team’s individual patient information. Click on any trend line in the “viz” tabs and then “Quick Explore” (look for the magnifying glass). In the “Explore” box, pick the item you want to explore and click “Drill To.” Keep using the Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. To return to the original settings, click on the gray “Reset Pivot Chart.” Team Data Table Shows means, medians, and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team’s priorities for learning from Modeling to Learn. Team data can be produced for one or all of the modules of Modeling to Learn: Care Coordination, Medication Management, Psychotherapy, Aggregate Mix of Services, and Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention. This file is uploaded in the Modeling to Learn* simulation user-interface (sim UI) for Modeling to Learn Blue teams. Once the query is done, you can:* View the “Params” tabs to show variables of interest as well as units, definitions, and calculations of the variables. View the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, which CPT codes are used to define each service, and the patient engagement patterns (for the Psychotherapy module). 2.2.6 Cheatsheets mtl.how/data cheatsheet SharePoint User Guide only accessible within the VA "]]
